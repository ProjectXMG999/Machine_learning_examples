    "### Interpreting the Learning Curves\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You might think about the information in the training data as being of two kinds: signal and noise. The signal is the part that generalizes, the part that can help our model make predictions from new data. The noise is that part that is only true of the training data; the noise is all of the random fluctuation that comes from data in the real-world or all of the incidental, non-informative patterns that can't actually help the model make predictions. The noise is the part might look useful but really isn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "We train a model by choosing weights or parameters that minimize the loss on a training set. You might know, however, that to accurately assess a model's performance, we need to evaluate it on a new set of data, the validation data. (You could see our lesson on model validation in Introduction to Machine Learning for a review.)\n",
    "\n",
    "When we train a model we've been plotting the loss on the training set epoch by epoch. To this we'll add a plot the validation data too. These plots we call the learning curves. To train deep learning models effectively, we need to be able to interpret them."

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "The validation loss gives an estimate of the expected error on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the training loss will go down either when the model learns signal or when it learns noise. But the validation loss will go down only when the model learns signal. (Whatever noise the model learned from the training set won't generalize to new data.) So, when a model learns signal both curves go down, but when it learns noise a gap is created in the curves. The size of the gap tells you how much noise the model has learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we would create models that learn all of the signal and none of the noise. This will practically never happen. Instead we make a trade. We can get the model to learn more signal at the cost of learning more noise. So long as the trade is in our favor, the validation loss will continue to decrease. After a certain point, however, the trade can turn against us, the cost exceeds the benefit, and the validation loss begins to rise.\n",
    "\n",
    "This trade-off indicates that there can be two problems that occur when training a model: not enough signal or too much noise. Underfitting the training set is when the loss is not as low as it could be because the model hasn't learned enough signal. Overfitting the training set is when the loss is not as low as it could be because the model learned too much noise. The trick to training deep learning models is finding the best balance between the two.\n",

To recognize these spurious patterns a network will often rely on very a specific combinations of weight, a kind of \"conspiracy\" of weights. Being so specific, they tend to be fragile: remove one and the conspiracy falls apart.\n",

    "This is the idea behind dropout. To break up these conspiracies, we randomly drop out some fraction of a layer's input units every step of training, making it much harder for the network to learn those spurious patterns in the training data.

    "With neural networks, it's generally a good idea to put all of your data on a common scale, perhaps with something like scikit-learn's StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler. The reason is that SGD will shift the network weights in proportion to how large an activation the data produces. Features that tend to produce activations of very different sizes can make for unstable training behavior.\n",

    "Now, if it's good to normalize the data before it goes into the network, maybe also normalizing inside the network would be better! In fact, we have a special kind of layer that can do this, the batch normalization layer. A batch normalization layer looks at each batch as it comes in, first normalizing the batch with its own mean and standard deviation, and then also putting the data on a new scale with two trainable rescaling parameters. Batchnorm, in effect, performs a kind of coordinated rescaling of its inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most often, batchnorm is added as an aid to the optimization process (though it can sometimes also help prediction performance). Models with batchnorm tend to need fewer epochs to complete training. Moreover, batchnorm can also fix various problems that can cause the training to get \"stuck\". Consider adding batch normalization to your models, especially if you're having trouble during training."

Accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions to total predictions: accuracy = number_correct / total. A model that always predicted correctly would have an accuracy score of 1.0. All else being equal, accuracy is a reasonable metric to use whenever the classes in the dataset occur with about the same frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with accuracy (and most other classification metrics) is that it can't be used as a loss function.

This substitute is the cross-entropy function.\n",
