    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless most values in the dropped columns are missing, the model loses access to a lot of (potentially useful!) information with this approach. As an extreme example, consider a dataset with 10,000 rows, where one important column is missing a single entry. This approach would drop the column entirely!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) A Better Option: Imputation\n",
    "Imputation fills in the missing values with some number. For instance, we can fill in the mean value along each column.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The imputed value won't be exactly right in most cases, but it usually leads to more accurate models than you would get from dropping the column entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) An Extension To Imputation\n",
    "Imputation is the standard approach, and it usually works well. However, imputed values may be systematically above or below their actual values (which weren't collected in the dataset). Or rows with missing values may be unique in some other way. In that case, your model would make better predictions by considering which values were originally missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this approach, we impute the missing values, as before. And, additionally, for each column with missing entries in the original dataset, we add a new column that shows the location of the imputed entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, this will meaningfully improve results. In other cases, it doesn't help at all.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1) Drop Categorical Variables\n",
    "The easiest approach to dealing with categorical variables is to simply remove them from the dataset. This approach will only work well if the columns did not contain useful information.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Ordinal Encoding\n",
    "Ordinal encoding assigns each unique value to a different integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "tut3_ordinalencode\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach assumes an ordering of the categories: \"Never\" (0) < \"Rarely\" (1) < \"Most days\" (2) < \"Every day\" (3).\n",
    "\n",
    "This assumption makes sense in this example, because there is an indisputable ranking to the categories. Not all categorical variables have a clear ordering in the values, but we refer to those that do as ordinal variables. For tree-based models (like decision trees and random forests), you can expect ordinal encoding to work well with ordinal variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) One-Hot Encoding¶\n",
    "One-hot encoding creates new columns indicating the presence (or absence) of each possible value in the original data. To understand this, we'll work through an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "tut3_onehot\n",
    "\n",
    "In the original dataset, \"Color\" is a categorical variable with three categories: \"Red\", \"Yellow\", and \"Green\". The corresponding one-hot encoding contains one column for each possible value, and one row for each row in the original dataset. Wherever the original value was \"Red\", we put a 1 in the \"Red\" column; if the original value was \"Yellow\", we put a 1 in the \"Yellow\" column, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to ordinal encoding, one-hot encoding does not assume an ordering of the categories. Thus, you can expect this approach to work particularly well if there is no clear ordering in the categorical data (e.g., \"Red\" is neither more nor less than \"Yellow\"). We refer to categorical variables without an intrinsic ranking as nominal variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-hot encoding generally does not perform well if the categorical variable takes on a large number of values (i.e., you generally won't use it for variables taking more than 15 different values)."

    "Introduction\n",
    "Machine learning is an iterative process.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will face choices about what predictive variables to use, what types of models to use, what arguments to supply to those models, etc. So far, you have made these choices in a data-driven way by measuring model quality with a validation (or holdout) set.\n",
    "\n",
    "But there are some drawbacks to this approach. To see this, imagine you have a dataset with 5000 rows. You will typically keep about 20% of the data as a validation dataset, or 1000 rows. But this leaves some random chance in determining model scores. That is, a model might do well on one set of 1000 rows, even if it would be inaccurate on a different 1000 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "At an extreme, you could imagine having only 1 row of data in the validation set. If you compare alternative models, which one makes the best predictions on a single data point will be mostly a matter of luck!\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the larger the validation set, the less randomness (aka \"noise\") there is in our measure of model quality, and the more reliable it will be. Unfortunately, we can only get a large validation set by removing rows from our training data, and smaller training datasets mean worse models,"

    "##### What is cross-validation?\n",
    "\n",
    "In cross-validation, we run our modeling process on different subsets of the data to get multiple measures of model quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we could begin by dividing the data into 5 pieces, each 20% of the full dataset. In this case, we say that we have broken the data into 5 \"folds\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we run one experiment for each fold:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Experiment 1, we use the first fold as a validation (or holdout) set and everything else as training data. This gives us a measure of model quality based on a 20% holdout set.\n",
    "- In Experiment 2, we hold out data from the second fold (and use everything except the second fold for training the model). The holdout set is then used to get a second estimate of model quality.\n",
    "- We repeat this process, using every fold once as the holdout set. Putting this together, 100% of the data is used as holdout at some point, and we end up with a measure of model quality that is based on all of the rows in the dataset (even if we don't use all rows simultaneously).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### When should you use cross-validation?\n",
    "Cross-validation gives a more accurate measure of model quality, which is especially important if you are making a lot of modeling decisions. However, it can take longer to run, because it estimates multiple models (one for each fold).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, given these tradeoffs, when should you use each approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "- For small datasets, where extra computational burden isn't a big deal, you should run cross-validation.\n",
    "- For larger datasets, a single validation set is sufficient. Your code will run faster, and you may have enough data that there's little need to re-use some of it for holdout.\n",
    "There's no simple threshold for what constitutes a large vs. small dataset. But if your model takes a couple minutes or less to run, it's probably worth switching to cross-validation.\n",

This leads to high performance on the training set (and possibly even the validation data), but the model will perform poorly in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, leakage causes a model to look accurate until you start making decisions with the model, and then the model becomes very inaccurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of leakage: target leakage and train-test contamination.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target leakage\n",
    "Target leakage occurs when your predictors include data that will not be available at the time you make predictions. It is important to think about target leakage in terms of the timing or chronological order that data becomes available, not merely whether a feature helps make good predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example will be helpful. Imagine you want to predict who will get sick with pneumonia. The top few rows of your raw data look like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "The model would see that anyone who has a value of False for took_antibiotic_medicine didn't have pneumonia. Since validation data comes from the same source as training data, the pattern will repeat itself in validation, and the model will have great validation (or cross-validation) scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the model will be very inaccurate when subsequently deployed in the real world, because even patients who will get pneumonia won't have received antibiotics yet when we need to make predictions about their future health.\n",
    "\n",
    "!!! To prevent this type of data leakage, any variable updated (or created) after the target value is realized should be excluded.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Train-Test Contamination\n",
    "A different type of leak occurs when you aren't careful to distinguish training data from validation data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that validation is meant to be a measure of how the model does on data that it hasn't considered before. You can corrupt this process in subtle ways if the validation data affects the preprocessing behavior. This is sometimes called train-test contamination.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine you run preprocessing (like fitting an imputer for missing values) before calling train_test_split(). The end result? Your model may get good validation scores, giving you great confidence in it, but perform poorly when you deploy it to make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all, you incorporated data from the validation or test data into how you make predictions, so the may do well on that particular data even if it can't generalize to new data. This problem becomes even more subtle (and more dangerous) when you do more complex feature engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "If your validation is based on a simple train-test split, exclude the validation data from any type of fitting, including the fitting of preprocessing steps. This is easier if you use scikit-learn pipelines. When using cross-validation, it's even more critical that you do your preprocessing inside the pipeline!\n",
